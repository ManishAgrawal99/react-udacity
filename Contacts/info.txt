Stateless Functional Component
When a Component only holds a render method and does not keep a track of the state, we can simply create a function,
with props as an argument and return the JSX

_________________________________

State of a Component

A property for a Component is received by its parent and is immutable
Whereas a state of the Component holds the data that could be changed,
Usually by a user input

We can create a state for the Component just by creating an object with the name state

These states could be accessed in that Component by using this.state

The initial state of the Component must never be taken from the props
props are set only when the Component is rendered
If the Component is not refreshed, the Component's state may not be updated

_________________________________

setState()

In order to change the state of the Component we cannot directly change the value,
since React will not know about the change in state.
Hence, setState is used to rerender the component in case of changed state.

setState() could take either of 2 parameters
1. Functional setState takes in a function where the argument is the previous state and that state is altered
2. Object -> It takes in an Object and that object is merged with the state

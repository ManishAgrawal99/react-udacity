It is givn by FB to set up the project to use JSX in our code
JSX requires to be transpiled into regular JavaScript before reaching the browser. 
We typically use a transpiler like Babel to accomplish this for us. 
We can run Babel through a build tool, like Webpack which helps bundle all of our assets (JavaScript files, CSS, images, etc.) for web projects.

To streamline these initial configurations, we can use Facebook's Create React App package to manage all the setup for us! This tool is incredibly helpful to get started in building a React app, as it sets up everything we need with zero configuration! 
Install Create React App (through the command-line with npm), and then we can walk through what makes it so great.

It gives babel, Webpack and Webpack dev server

Use     `create-react-app projName`     to create a starting project
